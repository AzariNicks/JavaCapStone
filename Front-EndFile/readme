Okay so your we have end points
and what they do so you can use it
so as of right now we sent it to the localHost so all the end points

---

http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/register
{
"username":"Anything",
"password":"Anything"
}
This is how to register for the account it works perfectly your gonna need to give it two things
a body and a password

---

http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/login
{
"username":"Anything",
"password":"Anything"
}
This is how you sign in it works perfectly
it'll return things in the response
try and see if you cant catch it with Java

http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notes/user/{userId}
{

        "body":"a bunch of words a whole lot of words my dude but yeah this is a body a big body "

}
This has the power to create a note the only thing it needs too and its just a body which is the paragraph and then at the same time it needs a User to plus it and thats it

---

http://localhost:8080/api/v1/notes/{noteId}
Nothing but the id of the note is needed and boom is gone
